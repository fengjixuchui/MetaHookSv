# MetaHookSv

This is a porting of MetaHook (https://github.com/nagist/metahook) for SvEngine (GoldSrc engine modified by Sven-Coop Team), 

mainly to keep you a good game experience in Sven-Coop.

It is currently not compatible with original GoldSrc engine, but it can be if broken signatures are fixed at future.

## Risk of VAC ?

Although using hook is likely to be dangerous in VAC protected games, there is no VAC ban reported yet.

Use a separate account to play Sven-Coop if you worry about getting banned, since Sven-Coop is a free game.

## Installation

0. git pull https://github.com/hzqst/MetaHookSv or download from https://github.com/hzqst/MetaHookSv/archive/main.zip

1. All required binaries and files are in "Build" folder, copy them to "\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sven Co-op\".

2. Launch game from "\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sven Co-op\svencoop.exe"

* The new "svencoop.exe" is renamed from "metahook.exe", you could run game from "metahook.exe -game svencoop" however it will cause game crash when changing video settings.

* The SDL2.dll fixes a bug that the IME input handler from original SDL library provided by valve was causing buffer overflow and game crash when using non-english IME. you don't need to copy it if you don't have a non-english IME.

## Build Instruction

1. git clone https://github.com/hzqst/MetaHookSv

2. Open "MetaHook.sln" with MSVC 2015 or MSVC 2017 (not tested yet with MSVC2019)

3. Build with Release configuration

4. Open "Plugins\CaptionMod\CaptionMod.sln" with MSVC 2015 or MSVC 2017 (not tested yet with MSVC2019)

5. Build with Release configuration

6. Open "Plugins\Renderer\Renderer.sln" with MSVC 2015 or MSVC 2017 (not tested yet with MSVC2019)

7. Build with Release configuration

9. If there is no compile error(s), all binaries should be generated under "Build" directory.

## Plugins

### CaptionMod

A subtitle plugin designed for displaying subtitles and translate in-game HUD text.

#### Features

1. Display subtitles when sound is played.

2. Display subtitles when sentence is played.

3. Display subtitles when there is a HUD TextMessage.

4. Translate HUD TextMessage dynamically (regex supported).

5. Hook original client's old-style HUD TextMessage and draw it with multi-byte character support.

6. Hook VGUI1's TextImage control paint procedure and draw it with multi-byte character support.

7. Custom dictionary for each map, put dictionary file at "/maps/[mapname]_dictionary.csv"

![](https://github.com/hzqst/MetaHookSv/raw/main/img/1.png)

There is a example demo shows you how to translate constant HUD TextMessage into other language in "svencoop\maps\restrictionXX_dictionary.csv", delete if you don't need them.

There is a example demo shows you how to translate dynamic HUD TextMessage into other language with regex in "svencoop\captionmod\dictionary_schinese.txt" called "#SVENCOOP_PLAYERINFO", however it won't take effect in game since Sven-Coop only uses "dictionary_english.txt" as localization file.

Modify and overwrite "dictionary_english.txt" is the best option if you are expected to use non-English language in game.

#### Console Vars

cap_enabled 0 / 1 : to enable or disable CaptionMod's subtitle display.

cap_netmessage 0 / 1 : to enable or disable CaptionMod's HUD TextMessage translation.

cap_debug 0 / 1 : to output debug message when there is a HUD TextMessage or sound playing.

### MetaRenderer

A graphic enhancement plugin that modifiy the original render engine.

You can even play with 200k epolys models and still keep a high framerate.

#### Features

1. High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) post-processor.

2. Simple water reflection and refraction. (Warning: this may cause a significant performance hit.)

3. Simple Per-Object Shadow. (Warning: this may cause a significant performance hit.)

4. Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO) using horizon-based ambient occlusion (HBAO). the implementation is taken from nvidia. (Warning: this may cause a significant performance hit when sampling radius is too large.) (Warning: you might see SSAO's black pixel fighting on wall or terrain if your defalt_fov is not 90)

5. MultiSampling Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) (High quality, low performance)

6. Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing (FXAA) when MSAA is not available. (Low quality, high performance)

7. Deferred-Shading and Per-Pixel-Dynamic-Lighting for all non-transparent objects. "unlimited" (maximum at 256 for SvEngine) dynamic lightsources are supported with almost no cost.

9. Vertex-Buffer-Object (VBO) "Batch-Draw" optimization and GPU-Lighting for studio model. With VBO enabled you will get higher framerate and lower CPU usage. You can get maximum at 8x FramePerSeconds than non-VBO mode in extreme case. (200k+ epolys with no FPS drop).

10. Vertex-Buffer-Object (VBO) "Batch-Draw" optimization for BSP terrain and brush model. With VBO enabled you will get higher framerate and lower CPU usage. Warning: this feature may cause the render result differs from the one in original game (e.g. random textures are disabled, non-visible terrain in current BSP-node are always visible.)

11. Normal texture and Parallax texture support for BSP terrain and brush model. Check svencoop/maps/restriction02_detail.txt for usage sample.
