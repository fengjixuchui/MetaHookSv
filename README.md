This is a porting of MetaHook (https://github.com/nagist/metahook) for SvEngine (GoldSrc engine modified by Sven-Coop Team),

Mainly to keep you a good game experience in Sven-Coop.

Most of plugins are still compatible with vanilla GoldSrc engine. please check plugin docs for compatibility.

## Risk of VAC ?

Although using hook is likely to be dangerous in games, there is no VAC ban reported yet.

As you can see Sven-Coop is not protected by VAC : https://store.steampowered.com/search/?term=coop&category2=8

Use a separate account to play Sven-Coop if you worry about getting banned, since Sven-Coop is a free game.

## Installation

0. git pull https://github.com/hzqst/MetaHookSv or download from https://github.com/hzqst/MetaHookSv/archive/main.zip

1. All required executable and resource files are in "Build" folder, pick [whatever resource you need](Build/README.md) and copy them to "\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sven Co-op\".

2. Launch game from "\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Sven Co-op\svencoop.exe"

* The new "svencoop.exe" is renamed from "metahook.exe", you could run game from "metahook.exe -game svencoop" however it will cause game crash when changing video settings.

* The SDL2.dll fixes a bug that the IME input handler from original SDL library provided by valve was causing buffer overflow and game crash when using non-english IME. you don't need to copy it if you don't have a non-english IME.
