# MetaRenderer documentation

### Build Instruction

1. Open "MetaHookSv\Plugins\Renderer\Renderer.sln"

2. Build with Release configuration

### Compatibility

|        Engine            |      |
|        ----              | ---- |
| GoldSrc_blob   (< 4554)  | -    |
| GoldSrc_legacy (< 6153)  | -    |
| GoldSrc_new    (8684 ~)  | √    |
| SvEngine       (8832 ~)  | √    |

For GoldSrc engine: Only compatible with metahook.exe from https://github.com/hzqst/MetaHookSv, not from other source.

#### Features

1. High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) post-processor.

2. Simple water reflection and refraction. (Warning: this may cause a significant performance hit.)

3. Simple Per-Object Shadow. (Warning: this may cause a significant performance hit.)

4. Screen Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO) using horizon-based ambient occlusion (HBAO). the implementation is taken from nvidia. (Warning: this may cause a significant performance hit when sampling radius is too large.) (Warning: you might see SSAO's black pixel fighting on wall or terrain if your defalt_fov is not 90)

5. MultiSampling Anti-Aliasing (MSAA) (High quality, low performance)

6. Fast Approximate Anti-Aliasing (FXAA) when MSAA is not available. (Low quality, high performance)

7. Deferred-Shading and Per-Pixel-Dynamic-Lighting for all non-transparent objects. "unlimited" (maximum at 256 for SvEngine) dynamic lightsources are supported with almost no cost.

9. Vertex-Buffer-Object (VBO) "Batch-Draw" optimization and GPU-Lighting for studio model. With VBO enabled you will get higher framerate and lower CPU usage. You can get maximum at 8x FramePerSeconds than non-VBO mode in extreme case. (200k+ epolys with no FPS drop).

10. Vertex-Buffer-Object (VBO) "Batch-Draw" optimization for BSP terrain and brush model. With VBO enabled you will get higher framerate and lower CPU usage. Warning: this feature may cause the render result differs from the one in original game (e.g. random textures are disabled, non-visible terrain in current BSP-node are always visible.)

11. Normal texture and Parallax texture support for BSP terrain and brush model. Check svencoop/maps/restriction02_detail.txt for usage sample.

12. Fixed an engine (both GoldSrc and SvEngine) bug that STUDIO_NF_MASKED was not working with remapped / colormap textures for studio-models.

#### Console Vars

r_hdr 1 / 0 : to enable or disable HDR(high-dynamic-range) post-processor. recommended value : 1

r_hdr_blurwidth : to control the intensity of blur for HDR. recommended value : 0.1

r_hdr_exposure : to control the intensity of exposure for HDR. recommended value : 5

r_hdr_darkness : to control the darkness for HDR. recommended value : 4

r_hdr_adaptation : to control the dark / bright adaptation speed for HDR. recommended value : 50

r_water 2 / 1 / 0 : enable or disable water reflection and refraction. 2 = draw all entities and terrains in reflection view, 1 = draw only terrains in reflection view. recommended value : 1

r_water_depthfactor (0.0 ~ 1000.0) : to determine if we can see through water in a close distance. recommended value : 50

r_water_normfactor (0.0 ~ 1000.0) : to determine the size of water wave (offset to the normalmap). recommended value : 1.5

r_water_novis 1 / 0 : force engine to render the scene which should have been removed by visleaf when rendering refraction or reflection view. recommended value : 1

r_water_minheight : water entity which has height < this value will not be rendered with shader program. recommended value : 7.5

r_shadow 1 / 0 : enable or disable Per-Object Shadow. recommended value : 1

r_shadow_angle_pitch (0.0 ~ 360.0) : to control the angle(pitch) of shadow caster (light source).
